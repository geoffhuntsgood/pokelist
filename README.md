# Pokélist:  Pokémon-related quizzes

This app lets you show off your Pokémon knowledge through various quizzes. Hosted at https://geoffhuntsgood.com/pokelist.

## Configuration

The app will start by displaying some settings.

The app allows choosing Pokémon, Moves, or Abilities by cycling through them with the left and right buttons.

**Pokémon:** A quiz can be built for all of them, or by generation (1-9), type (currently 1 of 18), or category (currently 1 of 6).

**Moves:** A quiz can be built for all of them, or by generation (1-9), type (currently 1 of 18), or damage category (currently 1 of 4).

**Abilities:** A quiz can be built for all of them or by generation (3-9).

## Taking the Quiz

After pressing "GO!", the quiz will display and the timer will start. Type your guesses into the box and they will automatically appear in the list below.

**Start over?:** The arrow button allows you to go back to make a different selection and generate another quiz.

**Give up?:** The X button will stop the timer and reveal all the answers. Answers you didn't find will be displayed in red.

**Pause:** Pauses the timer. While paused, you can't make guesses or look at the list. (No cheating!)

### Coming Soon

Hopefully a way to save your scores will be available soon.

Have fun, and send me screenshots!
